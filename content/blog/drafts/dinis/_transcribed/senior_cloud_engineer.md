Senior Cloud Security Engineer

One member of the team that we want to recruit is an experienced Cloud Security Engineer, and by that I mean somebody that has very deep expertise in Cloud Security. If I had to pick one, I'd say AWS, although you have a lot of stuff in Azure too. But we do a have a push for AWS. 

And the reason why we mapped this very senior person that is quite a good rate. It's because cloud today is as complex as an operating system, and the complexities and subtleties of the environment cannot be underestimated. So, we need somebody that is really good with the cloud, who basically eats it for lunch. Someone who geeks out everything about it, that knows exactly how it works, and has been working on it for years. This would be an advanced power user that scripts everything -- an individual that is going to be able to take our cloud environment to the next level.

It's also important to balance security with performance, maintainability, deployment, and resilience. My instinct is that security has to be one of those areas that really pushes knowledge to the limit. So, my expectation is that the person will have a huge amount of security expertise and will also have a strong focus on resilience, on reliability, on infrastructure. So, they will be a running survey monkey -- someone who just tries everything. They will also make sure that every system is able to survive by itself, and just generally has full control of what is happening.

The idea that you could have a server running and not know what it is should make you crazy. Because it could be something mining bitcoins; it could be a malicious server running. Forget about the cost issues. We need to have full visibility of what is running in our environment. So, the idea that the system is unauthenticated, or that systems don't authorize each other, or that they make connections without us understanding them -- from a security point of view, it's just crazy. It should never, ever, happen. We should have zero tolerance for not understanding what is happening in the cloud environment. And with the rate of innovation and everything that is going on in our industry, it's getting more and more complex to do this. So, we need somebody who really understands at a very deep level what is going on.

So, Photobox Group Security provides a spectacular opportunity for someone like this, because really, the tech team wants to be involved, the tech team is asking from an involvement. The tech team really driving hardware where is possible, and to with a cloud environment. And, of course, the next part is also using machine learning and artificial intelligence for security, which gets very exciting. We actually should be using the actual of AWS, the power of Azure, to actually helps us in security to understand what is going on, understand our practices, make sure that we have a group bust and resilience very effective environment to perform our duties as guardian of the data and the assets that we have there. 

This is going to be a very exciting project for someone to work on, because it's involved with protecting and helping the business itself. It's also a spectacular work to be used on how we consumers of those technologies, as we ourselves are moving into cloud, and our activities and understanding to scale. Somebody gives a pile of logs, we should be able to look them in the face and go, "Cool, and I can analyze that." If somebody wants to gives us a massive amount of strings of data, we should be able to deal with it. We should have the capabilities, the technology, and the workflows to be able to consume that amount of information.

So, that's my ideal person: somebody that really geeks out the cloud, and really wants to take it to the next level in an environment where that is embraced, encouraged, and celebrated.
