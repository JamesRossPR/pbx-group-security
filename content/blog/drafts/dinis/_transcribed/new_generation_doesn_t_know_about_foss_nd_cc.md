The Next Generation is Not Aware of Open Source or Creative Commons

Tonight, while having dinner with some friends, I spent some very enjoyable time talking to a 19-year-old who is at university doing political studies. What was absolutely shocking, although it shouldn't have been because I have heard it many times before, was how he had no idea of what open source or creative commons copyright licenses were. This is fascinating because these ideas have won the world. For my generation, they were radical ideas. If you talked about them you were called a communist, were told, "that will never work," and "that's crazy," and "there will be no financial model," and "it's something that will never exist." Now, of course, some of the biggest companies in the world develop on top of open source and use creative commons licenses. We have Wikipedia and tons of other open-source stuff. So, these ideas have definitely proved their commercial and practical value, not to mention their ethical value. But, somehow that is not filtering down to the universities, and it's crazy, because you would expect universities to be the champions of that kind of environment. 

So, the tragedy is that this generation is not being exposed to the thinking behind open-source. The thing is, it's not easy to think in this open way, to have this collaborative mindset. And this is the attitude that is required to write open-source materials and things that will fall under creative commons licenses. These young people are definitely missing a trick by not exploring and understanding this. Also, they are missing out on having a competitive advantage. Because, as someone who is beginning to build a career, your time at university should be a period of great creativity, should be a moment when you are experimenting and pushing stuff out. You should be exploring your ideas, making personal connections, and trying to create relationships that in the future might land you some really interesting opportunities or jobs. The idea that students are not exploring this graph-like world of publishing things, learning how to make things, learning how to get their heads around new ideas, writing and actually publishing a book, is distressing. They are missing out on important opportunities.

One of the comments I made to the 19-year-old I was speaking with was, "Look, get your head around these ideas. Write. Publish on sites like Medium or Amazon, for example, and get the links to those things out into the world. If you can do that you've got a job!" This kind of activity can be quite impressive, because not that many people will actually do it -- or even have the confidence to do it. But it can be incredibly valuable because that is how you start to push your ideas.

The key concept is that you have to write a lot. It's not about writing one respected book, or posting one spectacular idea that wins the world for you. It's constant publishing and work that allows you to be that "overnight success" after 100 blog posts, right? So, basically, that's why it is so important to publish and to write about things that you care about. You will learn about your inner voice this way.  

So, my recommendation to him was that he should write about the things he is passionate about. And that means not only the work that he does at university, but also things that he loves, for example, a great movie he saw, a documentary, a great article he read. He should write his ideas down and publish them. Then send the links to his friends and the people he knows, and comment on the work of others who are also doing these things. That's basically how he will build his brand. It's essential for him to build his brand and also to capture his ideas for his future self.

The takeaway is this: Even if he is the only person who ever reads that Medium post, the effort is completely worthwhile. I guarantee that when he reads that stuff a couple of years from now, he'll go, "Wow, that is really cool. That is a really good idea." If he hadn't captured that idea on Medium, it would simply have disappeared. And that idea, that little nugget of something that could have been quite spectacular, would have been lost forever.
