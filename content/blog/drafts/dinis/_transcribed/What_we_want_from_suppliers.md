What We Want from a Security Vendor

A security vendor helps you manage and protect your company's most valuable and irreplaceable asset: your data. So, what do we want from the suppliers of this essential service? What we want is a partner. We need someone who understands their role in assisting us to make the most out of the available technology. This is something that some of our existing suppliers are not providing. 

There are, of course, a great many spectacular success stories, and we have achieved proper partnership with some suppliers. These are the suppliers who have allocated resources to us, who actually spend time with us. These partners have worked to understand how we can best use their technology, make the most out of it, and save money. Some are so well integrated into our communications that they are on a Slack channel with us. They are available for questions and they share real-world information from other customers with us. That's what we want: proactive, integrated partners. It is such suppliers who also find ways for us to use more of their products -- it is a synergistic relationship. 

The point here is not change for the sake of change. We want healthy redirection. The bottom line is that we need value for money from all of our suppliers. This involves redefining many of our current supplier relationships. A basic requirement is the ability to communicate via Slack. Real-time conversations that empower us to make best use of the vendor's products. Such technology also allows us to educate; to capture discusions of problems and their solutions and put them on webforms, so that we can learn from each other and can create connections with other users of the service. 

The supplier relationship cannot be a one way street. There must be a sharing of knowledge and experiences. A supplier not meeting these needs must be replaced. Without a close working partnership, we simply can't justify the investment. Typically, the tools we invest in are high level, they have a steep learning curve, requiring large amounts of people-hour investment. If a supplier does not work with us closely enough, then we fail to gain value from their tools. 

We are motivated to find these suppliers and build these great partnerships, at good rates. We need to be empowered to assign a minimum amount of resource to ensure that each project leg is implemented. We are motivated to avoid suppliers who try to charge very high consulting rates for this, and who assign us highly specialized, yet inefficient engineers. The supplier should be able to provide the tools, the expertise to deploy and configure them, and the communication structure to ensure we break through the learning curve fast.

That's what we want from suppliers in 2018.
