How to Become a Security Expert

The best way to really get your head around security is to attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities.  So, the target audience of this post is good professionals, developers, who have a solid understanding of technology, who are moving into the security space. And we have a number of them on our team. 

One of the responsibilities we have is to take these professionals to the next level. There is a multiple stage approach for doing this. I'd say that the first one is to find vulnerabilities and write the exploits for those vulnerabilities. From that, you gain an understanding of the variation of the exploits. Then you try to fix them. And that workflow will walk you through a lot of paradigm shifts that you need to be prepared for. So, at the end of the process, you'll understand the problems of data, such as data validation, data handling, and the problems with data injections. You'll understand the problems with authentication authorization. You'll understand the problems of trusting who has a data, and who is making decisions. You'll understand the problem of encryption and protecting data, and the value of assets. You'll understand risk conditions. You'll also understand the human element and the workflows, development, and the use of the pipeline. So, basically, all of these stages will take you to those paradigm shifts. 

So, how do you do all of this? We provide security and a number of tools, techniques, and environments, that can help you make that happen. One of the most valuable tools, I'd say, is books. Books are a great way to learn. We probably have any books that the team wants -- our library is already quite extensive. And we'll gladly get more. Because books are basically masterclasses given by the masters and experts on a chosen subject, right? So, that's where you should really start. Books are the best technology for learning, due to their undivided focus and ability to explain the information.

Next, you do hands-on exercises. We use Avatron, which is a Hackathon platform. We make it available to everyone. And, basically, we have a couple of career paths that you should that. And that will also allow you to get hands-on experience with the vulnerabilities. The Hackathon challenges can actually be quite tricky. Working with them is a great learning experience. And the reality is that, at the beginning, it is very important to look at all the solutions, because sometimes just going to the exercise and understanding it can give you a lot of A-Ha! moments. The idea is to complete the exercises and to find the solution for yourself. Because even if you do it manually,  you will learn a lot. You do a lot of paradigm shifts.

The next part is when you actually like the exploit. So, that's when you start to code and like the exploits yourselves. The exploits are actually tests -- they are security tests. And that's where it gets interesting! Because once you can do that, you have a way to replicate the findings. And it is not easy to get to that level. Then, you write the exploits in a testing framework because that allows you look at the ability. This is very powerful, being able to actually go and fix stuff.

Another good exercise is to take some applications -- for example, the Juice Shop or some other vulnerable-by-design applications -- exploit them, and then write fixes for them. That is very powerful because it allows you to understand that fixing things and creating security protectors is much harder than breaking things.

But I do think that unless you start from breaking something, you will struggle. This is because you don't know what to test. You don't have that instinct to know,  "Hm ... Iâ€™m not sure I have enough coverage." You are not yet aware of the gaps in your understanding. 

So, that's how you do it. The faster you can do that loop, the more you become a security professional. And the more you start to understand what it takes to actually do an application in network security. 

Another thing -- a most important thing. A part of your learning curve is to ask questions. You have to find people that you respect and like, and ask them questions. Every good security professional I know loves to teach. They went through the learning process themselves. So, don't be afraid to ask questions. 

And finally, present. The best way to learn is to teach. So, one of the final stages of learning is to actually present and produce materials. When you present to your peers you will teach them something and you will deepen your knowledge. They will appreciate it and you will earn their respect, which is, in a way, the highest form of compliment. And that is what you want to achieve: the respect of your team. It's also the best job interview ever -- to present or talk about something that you have done, right? So, that's basically what you really want -- to get to a point where you are actually presenting your research.
